# Linear Regression Learnings

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates linear regression concepts and applications. The code provides a step-by-step explanation of linear regression and includes the use of the SciKit Learn library for linear regression.

## Overview

Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predictive modeling. In this project, we explore linear regression through code and visualize the relationship between two variables: head size and brain weight.

## Code Contents

- **Data Preparation**: Reading and exploring the 'headbrain.csv' dataset.
- **Calculating Coefficients**: Manually calculating the regression coefficients (slope and intercept) using the least squares method.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the regression line along with scatter points to visualize the linear relationship.
- **Calculating R^2 Value**: Calculating the coefficient of determination (R^2) to assess the goodness of fit.
- **Using SciKit Learn**: Implementing linear regression using the SciKit Learn library for comparison.
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculating the R^2 score using SciKit Learn and confirming it matches the manually calculated R^2 value.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Download the 'headbrain.csv' dataset and place it in the same directory as the code.
4. Run the code to explore linear regression concepts and visualize the linear relationship between head size and brain weight.

```python
python linear_regression_learnings.py
```

## Results

This project provides a hands-on learning experience for linear regression, demonstrating both manual calculation of coefficients and the use of the SciKit Learn library for linear regression modeling. It also calculates and compares the R^2 score to assess model performance.
